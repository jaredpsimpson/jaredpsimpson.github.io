Well, here is my first post.  Just to test the syntax highlighting for my perfered language (C#), I have included the following:

{% highlight csharp %}
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

`#=> prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.`

I will be using this site to post information about personal projects that I am working on along with new technologies that I am learning about. I am currently the President of the Fort Worth .NET User Group ([FWDNUG][fwdnug]).
Check us out if you are in the area.

I am currently interested in web application development, IoT, cloud computing, design, microcontrollers, and the developer community. Stay tuned if you are interested in those topics. Oh, and thanks for stopping by.
