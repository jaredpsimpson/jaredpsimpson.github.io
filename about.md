My name is Jared P. Simpson, and I'm a web application developer from Fort Worth, TX. I am currently the President of the Fort Worth .NET User Group (<a href="http://fwdnug.com">FWDNUG</a>), and focus mainly on things related to Microsoft's .NET technologies. 

I also have an interest in IoT, cloud computing, hardware, the developer communities, and wakeskating among many other things. This is where I will be sharing my thoughts on those matters.
